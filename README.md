# Process and Service Design Project
This project consists in designing and implementing a House Renovation Company (HRC) which relies on several services:

• Plumbers

• Electricians

• Constructors

A client, also called householder, asks the company for a renovation, and according to what the householder needs to be done the HRC contacts the services. Once it has chosen the best ones, then the work can start.
